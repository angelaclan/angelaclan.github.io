  <blockquote> "More and more people are seeking the joys and benefits of a simpler, more natural existence, 
      	 looking beyond the endless temptations of consumerism to devise new, meaningful, 
         contemporary lifestyles.– Dominique Loreau"  </blockquote>
  <p>A chair embodies a lot in one small package: engineering, materiality, practicality, and, most of all, imagination. You can love a sofa, a bed, or a table, but they don't pull at the heartstrings the way a perfect chair does. A successful chair represents more than the marriage of form and function—it rises to the level of art.</p>
